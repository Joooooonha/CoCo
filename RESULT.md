# CoCo Development Result

## 2026-07-22 - Phase 1.1 Domain models and seed data

- Added the shared course, route point, element, user, reaction, and enum models.
- Added two deterministic Seoul seed courses for development and previews.
- Kept Apple map types out of the domain model so the server contract is not tied to MapKit.
- HIG files loaded: none; this step does not change user interface behavior or presentation.
- Verification: `xcodebuild` Debug build for the generic iOS Simulator succeeded with Xcode 26.3 and the iOS 26.2 SDK.

## 2026-07-22 - Phase 1.2 Course exploration map

- Replaced the starter screen with a MapKit course exploration experience.
- Added a persistent native sheet with collapsed and expanded detents, a two-course list, course selection and deselection, and inline element counts.
- Added selected-course route rendering, start and finish markers, category-specific element pins, a legend, and an element detail overlay.
- Kept search, filters, current-location access, and element media out of this milestone as required by `SPEC.md`.
- Used Figma Make version 20 as the visual reference. The Figma design-context API does not support Make files, so the running Make preview and its accessible structure were inspected in the signed-in browser.
- Used a native SwiftUI `Map` and system sheet. Map content is inset above the collapsed sheet so Apple Maps attribution remains visible.
- Added 44-point icon controls, SF Symbols, semantic system colors, Dynamic Type styles, VoiceOver labels and hints, and light/dark material backgrounds.

### HIG files loaded

- Tier 1: `accessibility`, `branding`, `color`, `dark-mode`, `design-principles`, `icons`, `images`, `inclusion`, `layout`, `materials`, `motion`, `privacy`, `right-to-left`, `sf-symbols`, `typography`, `writing`.
- Tier 2: `designing-for-ios`.
- Tier 3: `maps`, `sheets`, `lists-and-tables`, `buttons`, `feedback`, `gestures`, `modality`.
- Related: `multitasking`, `action-sheets`, `popovers`, `panels`, `outline-views`, `collections`, `pull-down-buttons`, `pop-up-buttons`, `toggles`, `segmented-controls`, `playing-haptics`, `playing-audio`, `drag-and-drop`, `alerts`, `activity-views`.

### Verification

- `xcodebuild` Debug build for the generic iOS Simulator succeeded with Xcode 26.3 and the iOS 26.2 SDK.
- Ran the app on an iPhone 16e simulator and visually checked the default collapsed state, selected route state, expanded course list, and element detail overlay.
- Checked the element detail state in both light and dark appearances.
- No UI test target exists yet; interaction states were verified with temporary initial state injection that was removed before the final build.

## 2026-07-22 - Phase 2.1 Server scaffold and API contract

- Added a Spring Boot 4.1.0 server project under `server/` with the Gradle 9.5.1 Wrapper.
- Added Web MVC, Validation, Data JPA, Security, Actuator, Flyway, and PostgreSQL dependencies.
- Fixed Java source, target, and compiler release compatibility at Java 21 while allowing Gradle to run on the installed JDK 22.
- Defined the Phase 2 guest-authentication, course-list, course-detail, and error response contracts in `SPEC.md`.
- HIG files loaded: none; this server-only step does not change user interface behavior or presentation.
- Verification: `./gradlew compileJava` succeeded.

## 2026-07-23 - Phase 2.2 PostgreSQL schema and seed data

- Added a localhost-only PostgreSQL 17 Compose service with health check, persistent volume, and environment-variable configuration.
- Added Flyway migrations for users, hashed auth tokens, courses, route points, elements, scraps, and reactions with ownership, uniqueness, range, and enum constraints.
- Added the two iOS seed courses to PostgreSQL with six route points and three elements each.
- Added JPA entities and detail-fetching repositories without exposing entities as API responses.
- A real PostgreSQL test exposed both a multiple-bag fetch error and joined-collection duplication; internal collections now use sets and return explicitly sorted lists.
- HIG files loaded: none; this server-only step does not change user interface behavior or presentation.
- Verification: `./gradlew test --rerun-tasks` succeeded with Testcontainers PostgreSQL 17; `docker compose config`, container health, Flyway startup, and direct seed counts were also verified.

## 2026-07-23 - Phase 2.3 Guest authentication and course APIs

- Added stateless guest authentication with 30-day bearer tokens; only SHA-256 token hashes are persisted.
- Added JSON authentication failures and stable API error responses for protected and missing resources.
- Added authenticated course-list and course-detail endpoints that return route points and course elements in deterministic order.
- Added integration coverage for guest creation, valid and invalid authentication, both seeded courses, course detail, and missing-course errors.
- Disabled Spring Boot's unused generated development user so the custom bearer-token flow is the only application authentication path.
- HIG files loaded: none; this server-only step does not change user interface behavior or presentation.
- Verification: `./gradlew test --rerun-tasks` succeeded; the Compose-backed server reported `UP`, issued a real guest token, and returned both seeded courses over HTTP.
